## Modeling an Experimentally Observed Effect of Microgravity on Action Potential Interspike Interval

This is the 2 page summary of a project that was done by the first author, Dan Jones, as his lab project in my Cellular Neuroscience class. The project is a *very* long R markdown document that contains an implementation of the Hodgkin-Huxley neural model and Dan's exhaustive parameter testing to test hypotheses regarding what happens to neurons in microgravity.
We've submitted this work to the Computational and Systems Neuroscience (Cosyne) 2017 conference.
